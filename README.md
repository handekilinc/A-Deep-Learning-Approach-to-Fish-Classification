## Project Steps 𓆝 𓆟 𓆞 𓆝

### Dataset Preparation
- Loaded the fish dataset and organized it into a structured DataFrame.
- Visualized a selection of samples from different species to understand dataset diversity.

### Data Exploration
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to investigate class distributions and identify any imbalances.
- Generated visualizations, including histograms and pie charts, to represent the distribution of fish species.

### Image Processing
- Resized images to a uniform dimension (128x128 pixels) and normalized pixel values to a scale of 0 to 1.
- Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets to facilitate proper model evaluation.
- 
### Model Building
- Constructed a Sequential ANN model with:
  - Input layer
  - Multiple hidden layers with activation functions (e.g., ReLU)
  - Dropout layers for regularization to combat overfitting
  - Output layer with softmax activation for multi-class classification
- Compiled the model using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.0001 and categorical cross-entropy loss.

### Model Training
- Trained the model using the training dataset while validating on the validation set.
- Implemented early stopping based on validation loss to avoid overfitting.
- Achieved the following metrics during training:
  - **Training Loss:** 0.2877
  - **Validation Loss:** 0.3683
  - **Training Accuracy:** 90.00%
  - **Validation Accuracy:** 88.16%
- The model demonstrated a successful classification accuracy of approximately 90% on the validation set.

### Evaluation
- Generated a detailed classification report, including precision, recall, and F1 score for each class.
- Created a confusion matrix to visualize model performance across different classes.
- Plotted the ROC curve to illustrate the true positive rate versus the false positive rate for each class, providing insights into model discriminative power.

### Visualization
- Developed visualizations to display:
  - Training and validation accuracy over epochs.
  - Training and validation loss over epochs.
  - Confusion matrix.
  - ROC curve for each class to assess the model's performance comprehensively.

## How ANN Works 𓆝 𓆟 𓆞 𓆝

![Artificial Neural Network](assets/artificial%20neural%20network.png)

Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are inspired by biological neural networks and consist of interconnected layers of nodes (neurons). Each neuron processes input data and learns to map inputs to outputs through training. During the training process:
- Each neuron receives input, applies a weight, and passes the result through an activation function.
- The model adjusts the weights based on the error between predicted and actual outputs using backpropagation.
- The learning continues until convergence or early stopping criteria are met.

## Libraries Used 𓆝 𓆟 𓆞 𓆝
